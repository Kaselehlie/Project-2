const randomDecimal= Math.random()
const range = 33 - 3 + 1; // 31
const randomInRange = randomDecimal * range; // Adjusts the range to get a number between 0 (inclusive) and the value of 'range' (exclusive).
const randomInt = Math.floor(randomInRange); // Convert the decimal number to an integer to get values between 0 and (range - 1).
const shiftValue = randomInt + 3; // Shift the range to get an integer between 3 and 3
//Step 1 Generate a decimal number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive) using JavaScript's Math functions.

const range = 33-3+1 //step2: Determine the desired range of numbers for our secret shift value, which is between 3 and 33.

const randomInrange = randomDecimal * range//Step 3: Using the random decimal number generated in Step 1, adjust its value to fit within the desired range determined in Step 2.


const randomInt = Math.floor(randomInRange);//## Step 4 ðŸ§©Round down the decimal number obtained in Step 3 to get a whole integer.

const shiftValue = randomInt + 3;//Step 5: adjust the integer obtained in Step 4 to fit within the range of 3 to 33, inclusive.

// Question 1: Why did we add 1 to the difference between 33 and 3? Answer: We added 1 to ensure we include both endpoints of our range, 3 and 33, so we have a total of 31 possible numbers (from 3 to 33 inclusive).


// Question 2: How does multiplying `randomDecimal` by `range` help us get a number within our desired range? Answer: Doing so allows us to get a decimal in our desired range

// Q3: Why do we use the Math.floor() function instead of other rounding methods like Math.round()? A: This function ensures we are rounding down to the nearest whole # which gives us an integer between 0 and range -1. This prevents us frm exceeding our desired range.


// Q4:How does adding 3 to randomInt ensure that our final shiftValue is between 3 and 33? A: Since randomInt is a number between 0 and range - 1 (which is 30 in this case), adding 3 shifts this range upward, resulting in numbers between 3 and 33 inclusive.
