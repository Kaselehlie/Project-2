    <h1>Creating a Secret Shift Value for Caesar</h1>

    <p>
      Amidst the bustling streets of ancient Rome 🏛️, Julius Caesar heard of a
      new method to improve his secret cipher. The fixed shift was too
      predictable! "What if," he pondered, "the shift value itself was a secret,
      and it changed every time? 🤔"
    </p>

    <p>
      He decided that every invite to his secret party 🍾 would not only be
      encrypted but would also use a random shift value between 3 and 33. This
      would make the cipher even more mysterious and harder to crack!
    </p>

    <p>
      However, the challenge was ensuring that both the sender (Caesar) and the
      receiver (his trusted friends) knew this secret shift value. He decided to
      hide the shift value in a secret emblem 🌌 on the invitation. Only those
      who knew where to look could find it and decrypt the message.
    </p>

    <p>
      Intrigued by this new method, Brutus eagerly awaited his invitation to see
      if he could uncover the secret shift value and decode Caesar's message.
